# Basic Linear Regression algorithm (Work in progress)
## Description

This is a basic linear regression algorithm written in javascript. It is still a work in progress with just bare bones and limited functionality, but it can be tested in action [here](https://ignasc.github.io/linear-regression-demo/), where you can find an interactive graph that generates random data points and lets you adjust theta0 and theta1 coeficients to fit a line that would represent those data points. You can then choose to activate linear regression algorithm and let it work out theta0 and theta1 and see how well you managed to fit your line, compared to calculated line.

## Features
- Takes in full data set and works out training batch size.
- Training batch is generated by picking random values from data set.
- initial Theta0 and Theta1 can be selected manually (optional).

## Future plans
- Add ability to standardise data.
- Turning ON/OFF the noise addition, a.k.a. adding randomness to data points.
- Automatic learning rate adjustment during learning progress.
- Overall comments and information for easier use.
